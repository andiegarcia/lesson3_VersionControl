                <p> <b>Git</b> is a free and open source version control system (VCS).  It is designed to work fast and efficiently for a variety of projects ranging from small to large.  Git has become popular for its easy to learn formatting and helpful tips.  It has beat out many other software that use a version control system.  Not only is it free, but it is also smarter than the other software because it prevents unintentional overwrites of documents.  Some of the basic git commands include git init, git add—all, git log, and git status. </p>
                <p> Git interests me because it is so useful and easy to learn.  It is important to our course because we will be utilizing it in order to understand exactly where our mistakes are coming from. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                <p> <b>Version Control</b>  is the management of changes to any different types of collections of data, such as documents, computer programs, and large web sites.  This data is managed and identified by a code of numbers or letters.  Version control is also known as revision control or source control.  The name says it all; version control, revision control, and source control are all the collected data of each entry and its revision.  This allows for the ability to go back to a previous version of a document, giving users, such as editors, the option and ability to track the progress of their work. </p>
                <p> I am interested in this topic because I have never heard of a version control system before, nor did I know how it functioned.  I think that this topic is important to our course because with coding, we need to know how to trace our steps back to find any mistakes we may have made.</p>

            <p class="lead">
                <p> <b> A Git Repository </b> is one of the most important basic commands that one needs to know.  The purpose of a git repository is to manage documents or projects as they change over time, containing a set of commit objects and references to commit objects.  There are two ways to get a git repository:  the first is to turn a directory that is not under version control into a git repository, or clone a repository from somewhere else. </p>
                <p> The git repository interests me because it is something that I never even considered needing or being helpful.  I think that git repository is important to our course because we need to understand how to manage our documents with this set of commands under our belt.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                <p> <b>Recording Changes to the Repository</b> is important to the well being and conciseness of your work.  You’ll want to make changes and commit snapshots of the changes into your repository.  There are two states that a file can take: either tracked or untracked.  Tracked files are ones that were in the last snapshot, or ones files that Git already knows about.  Untracked files are the remaining, those that were not in the last snapshot and are new to your repository.  As you work on these files, they will become tracked because Git knows them and sees them as modified files.</p>
                <p> I think that understanding the different between tracked and untracked files and knowing how to record changes to the repository is extremely important because it makes our work so much easier when it is all tracked in GitHub.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                <p>The <b>Basics of Git</b> are simple enough.  Git does not store data in a common or normal way.  Instead, Git thinks of incoming data as a series of snapshots of a small file system.  Anytime you commit in Git, it takes a picture of what everything looks like and stores that information for future reference.  Git is different from other version control systems in this way.</p>
                <p>This interests me because understanding exactly what Git and Verison Control Systems are is complicated.  I think that going back to the basics is essential, especially for something as complex as this, and it has helped me a lot.  This is important to our course work because we will be dealing with Git a lot and we need to know exactly what and how it is storing our data.</p>
